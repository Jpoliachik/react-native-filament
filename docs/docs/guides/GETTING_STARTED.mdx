## Installing the library

Install [react-native-filament](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-filament) through npm:

```bash
npm i react-native-filament
cd ios && pod install
```

## Configure metro

You'll likely import 3D related files when using react-native-filament. To make sure metro can resolve these files, you need to add the following to your `metro.config.js`:

```js
const {getDefaultConfig, mergeConfig} = require('@react-native/metro-config');

/**
 * Metro configuration
 * https://metrobundler.dev/docs/configuration
 *
 * @type {import('metro-config').MetroConfig}
 */
const config = {
    resolver: {
        // This makes it possible to import .glb files in your code:
        assetExts: ['glb']
    }
};

const defaultConfig = getDefaultConfig(__dirname)

module.exports = mergeConfig(defaultConfig, config);
```

:::info
react-native-filament only supports loading .glb files for 3d models.
:::

## Basic example: Render your first 3D model

For seeing some 3D content on the screen in your app, you need the following things:

- 🏞️ A view to draw the 3D content to (the `<FilamentView>` component)
- 💡 A light source, otherwise the scene will be black (the `<DefaultLight>` component)
- 📦 A 3D model file (e.g. a .glb file)
- 📹 A camera through which the scene is observed and projected onto the view (the `<Camera>` component)

```jsx
import { FilamentScene, FilamentView, DefaultLight, Model, Camera } from "react-native-filament";
import MyModel from "./MyModel.glb";

function MyScene() {
  return (
    <FilamentScene>

      {/* 🏞️ A view to draw the 3D content to */}
      <FilamentView style={{ flex: 1 }}>

          {/* 💡 A light source, otherwise the scene will be black */}
          <DefaultLight />

          {/* 📦 A 3D model */}
          <Model source={MyModel} />

          {/* 📹 A camera through which the scene is observed and projected onto the view */}
          <Camera />

      </FilamentView>
    </FilamentScene>
  );
}
```

Additionally you see that we use the `<FilamentScene>` component to wrap our scene. This is necessary to provide the necessary react context for the scene to work correctly.

Everything that's part of your 3D scene should be rendered as part of the `<FilamentView>` component.

:::warning
Trying to render regular react-native components inside the `<FilamentView>` might work, but is not directly supported and might lead to unexpected behavior. Instead you can
render on top of it by using a `position: absolute` view.
