Transforming refers to changing the position, rotation or scale of an object in the scene.

</div>

## Position

By default models are rendered at the origin `[0, 0, 0]`. You can change the position of a model by providing a `position` prop:

```tsx
import { Model } from "react-native-filament"

const x = 0
const y = -1
const z = 0

<Model position={[x, y, z]} />
```

Units in filament are physically based, so 1 unit is 1 meter.

## Rotation

You can rotate a model by providing a `rotation` prop:

```tsx
import { Model } from "react-native-filament"

const rotationInDegree = 45;
const angleInRadians = (rotationInDegree * Math.PI) / 180;
const rotateOnAxis = [0, 1, 0]; // Rotate on the y-axis

<Model
  rotation={{
    angle: angleInRadians,
    axis: rotateOnAxis,
  }}
/>
```

We need to specify the axis on which we want to apply the rotation and the angle in radians.

## Scale

You can scale a model by providing a `scale` prop for the x, y and z axis:

```tsx
import { Model } from "react-native-filament"

const scale = 2;

<Model scale={[scale, scale, scale]} />
```

## Matrix multiplication

By default the transformation props are being multiplied to the current transform of the model. They are being multiplied in the order `scale` -> `rotation` -> `position` (SRT).
This means that if you first apply a scale of `[2,2,2]` and then later apply a scale of `[3,3,3]` the final scale will be `[6,6,6]`. To avoid this behaviour you
can specify the `multiplyWithCurrentTransform` prop and set it to false to disable this behaviour:

```tsx
import { Model } from "react-native-filament"

function GrowingModel() {
    const [scale, setScale] = useState(1);
    const growModel = () => setScale(scale + 1);

    return (
        <Model
            scale={[scale, scale, scale]}
            // Disables multiplication with current, and grows the model by 1 unit each time growModel is called
            multiplyWithCurrentTransform={false}
        />
    )
}
```

:::warning
When **disabling** the multiplication with the current transform, you'll reset all previous transformations (including rotation and position) and only apply the new transformations.

:::warning
When matrix multiplication is **enabled (default)** all transform operations will be applied on a fast refresh. Keep this in mind during development if something starts to look off.

## Animate the transform props

You may want to change the transformation props very frequently (e.g. every frame). To avoid performance issues, you should **not** update the props uusing `useState` directly, but use shared values.

You may know shared values from `reanimated`. We are using the shared values from `react-native-worklets-core`, but they work very similary.

You can create a new shared value using `useSharedValue`:


```tsx
import { useSharedValue } from "react-native-worklets-core";

function MyScene() {
  const rotation = useSharedValue(0);

  // ...
}
```

You can pass a shared value to any of the transformation props:

```tsx
function MyScene() {
  const rotation = useSharedValue({
    
  });

  return <Model rotation>
}
